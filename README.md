# Handwritten-digit-detector
A python program that trains a Knearest neighbours model on the MNIST data set(which is in the form of a CSV file) to recognise handwritten digits.
Implemented into a TKinter GUI which had a button to train the model, a button to load in your own png file with a handwritten digit and a button to output the model accuracy.
